This playbook is intended to install and configure mariadb 10.5 on multiple nodes with the intent of running them as a galera cluster. 
This is a very barebones configuration and is intended only to configure the galera cluster itself and not any databases, datbases users, or any common security configurations (though I intend to work on this). 

More than anything this is a learning opportunity.
